We have added a new plugin called Copilot to the project. This plugin includes three new packages:

1. **copilot**: Contains the user interface and main functionalities of the Copilot plugin.
2. **copilot-backend**: Includes the server logic and integrations for the Copilot plugin.
3. **copilot-common**: Contains shared components and utilities between the copilot and copilot-backend packages.

#### Main Features:

- Initial implementation of the Copilot user interface.
- Basic setup of the Copilot backend.
- Common components and utilities to facilitate code reuse between packages.
